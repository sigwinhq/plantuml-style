# PlantUML style

[PlantUML](http://www.plantuml.com) is an awesome Text to UML tool.

The default style choices are unfortunate. This attempts to solve the problem. 

## Usage

For the lazy: Use the following on the top of your file:

```puml
!includeurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sigwinhq/plantuml-style/master/style.puml
```
